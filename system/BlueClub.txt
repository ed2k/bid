2.

Responses to 1C opening (control showing) with intervention


   Intervention                    Response
   ------------                       --------
   Double                           Pass: 0 - 3
    1D  : 4 - 5
    Redouble: 4 - 5 C suit
    1H and above: as original

   1D/1H/1S                        Pass: for original 1D
    Double: for original 1H
    Next step and above: 3 controls etc
    2H/2S: as original

   1NT                                Pass: 0 - 5
    Double: for penalties (6+)
    2C/2D: 0 - 5, long suit, non-forcing
    2H/2S: as original

   2C/2D/2H/2S                    Double: for penalties
    2NT:    3 - 4 controls
    Cue bid: 5 or more controls

   3 level                             Pass: 0 - 6
    Double: For penalties
    Suit: non-forcing, contesting 7 - 8 points

   Summary:
1) After intervention by 1D/1H/1S, Pass replaces 1D and Double replaces
   1H, gaining one step on 1D intervention and losing 1 step on 1S
   intervention.

        2) On intervention by double, opportunity is made available to show
   0 - 3 or 4 -5 points.

        3) On intervention by 1NT or above, double is always for penalties

4) On intervention at 2 level, 2NT and  cue bid show controls.

    4H/4S: Five carder

 Summary
 -------
 1) 1D/1H: shows max 2 controls and then controls are shown step wise
 2) 1H is 6+ and forcing to 2NT level. If opener or responder bid 2NT after
    next bid by either, it shows minimum hand, which can either be passed or
    with more points, opener or responder should cross 2NT level with or without
    jump.
 3) After 1D, opener bids canape' style for finding a fit on unbalanced hand
    but after 1H/S etc response, opener bids naturally always 5 carder first
 4) After any response, opener bids NT on balanced hand after which responder's
    minimum C is gladiator and min D is stayman, if response was 1D and
    min C is Baron on any other response
 5) Baron is employed only by "RESPONDER" and not by opener. Opener must first
    show balanced hand by bidding NT
 6) Gladiator is employed only by "RESPONDER" to show 0 - 3 points and no game
    desire on his part
 7) With a fit (Axx, Kxx) opener or responder should raise to set the ground
    for cue-bidding at low level

                            Any other call is signoff
     
Summary
-------
1) Response of 2S may be 3 carder with a very weak hand to sign off
2) Response of 2NT shows poor hand with 6 carder and opener bids NBS.
3) Response of 3 of a suit shows fair suit, which opener with min and no
   fit should pass in a hurry. With a fit, opener bids his "ACTUAL SINGLETON"
   and not NBS, on which responder shows quality of his suit and holding of a
   singleton or otherwise.
4) Response of 2H is relay asking for point range and singleton. Opener's first
   three steps are for 17 - 20 range(2S: major +, 2NT C+, 3C: D+) and next four
   steps are 21 - 24 range(3D=H+,3H+S+,3S=C+,3NT=D+)
5) After responder has employed 2H relay, any call by him is a sign off unless
   he continues to bid opener's singleton.

Summary:
-------
1) 3 C by responder is gladiator, making it possible to sign off in 3D
2) 3D is stayman and followed by 4 C is asking for distribution


PART III - Development of Weak Calls
1.

Development of 2H/2S (6-11 Rule of 2 and 3) six carder
 
   2S/2NT Relay for points and quality (P and Q)
  Stepwise response (P before Q)
  1st step: 6 - 9, two top honors missing
  2nd step: 6 - 9, with two top honors
  3rd step: 10 - 11, two top honors missing
  4th step: 10 - 11, with two top honors
  5th step: Suit headed with AKQ
   New Suit:  Forcing one round

2.

 Development of 3NT (solid 7-carder minor headed with AKQ)

   Pass: To play
   4C relay asking for singleton(+)
 4D: D+
 4H: H+
 4S: S+
 4NT: No +
         5C: D +                <<< Remember >>> 5C is D+
 5D: C +             <<< Remember >>> 5D is C+

3.

Development of other weak openings

New suit is forcing one round
Another new suit next round game force.


PART IV - BASIC CONCEPTS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF NORMAL CALLS (13 - 16)

1.

FOR OPENER: Single suiter

   i) Hand with 13-14 is considered weak. Hand with 15-16 is considered strong
      ONLY if the suit is good.

  ii) Weak hand is shown by bidding min. NT, rebid or raise

 iii) Strong hand is shown by jump bid.
       2NT: good six carder, max AJ
       In suit: semi solid six carder

  iv) Balanced 16-17 hand is opened 1NT
  
   v) With 13-16, C suit, opening bids are
   1D : 13-14 VUL, weak 4 or 5 carder C
   1NT: 13-14 NON VUL or 15 VUL, weak 4 or 5 carder C
   2C : 13-16, very good C suit
   3C : 13-16 seven carder very good C suit, 7-8 playing tricks
2.

FOR OPENER: Two Suiter canape' style


   i) Weak hand is shown by higher, then lower suit (second suit is at least as
      long as first suit, may be longer), or by NT or raise. After 1NT response
      canape' is not guaranteed as bid of lower second suit is to find best fit.

  ii) Weak hand with 4 D and 4S is opened 1S with tolerance for H, otherwise 1D
 iii) Strong hand is shown by:
          reverse(not at 1 level): Second suit, 5 carder
  Jump in second suit: Second suit semi-solid six carder (except when
       second suit is C in which case it shows 4 carder
       C and semisolid six carder first suit)
          Jump in partner's suit: when opener was himself going to reverse in
  that suit
3.

FOR RESPONDER: single suiter

   i) 1 over 1 is 6+ (one round force), 1NT is 8-10, 2 over 1 is 11+ forcing to
      2NT
  ii) Second round jump in own suit is 10-11, semi solid six carder
 iii) Second round jump in opener's 1 D suit is 9-10 non forcing but in opener's
      1H/S suit is 12+, SuperFit, forcing
  iv) New suit at 3 level with or without a jump is forcing
   v) hands with 12+ are shown by:
   Reverse : second suit five carder (Responder uses 2C or 2D as
         first bid, even with 3 carder but with some
      values, to prepare for reverse
           Jump in a new suit: Semi-solid six carder
 Cue bid in opponents' suit, opener to bid NT with a stopper
 Second round jump in opener's major: SuperFit (Min 4 card support
                                        with two top honors.
           Using SuperFit calls (See item 5)
4.

FOR RESPONDER: Two suiter
   -------------
   i) Hands upto 11 points are bid in canape' style,  higher then lower or NT
      or raise
  ii) Hands with 12+ are shown by:
     Reverse at 2 level: first suit always min 4 carder except when it
                  or higher is D three carder with values
                Second round jump in new suit: first suit min 4 carder, second suit
                  semi solid six carder
5.

FOR RESPONDER: SUPERFIT calls in opener's major

   SUPERFIT means 12+, minimum 4 card support with two top honors in opener's
   first major or five card support in opener's second major where opener was
   going to reverse in that suit.
   Responder shows controls (A or K, not singleton or void) with superfit as
   follows:

   i) 1H/S by opener followed by rebid of 2H/2S/2NT

      2C - 4C        : control in C, not in D
      2D - 4D        : control in D, not in C
      2C - 4D        : Alike controls in C and D (A for Ascending)
      2D - 4C        : Different controls in C and D (D for Descending)

  ii) 1S by opener followed by 2H

      2C/2D - 3S     : Superfit in S, control in C/D, control in other minor not
       denied. Opener was going to employ superfit call if rebid
       was 2S or 2NT
      2C/2D - 4C     : Superfit in H, 5 card support. Responder was going to
       reverse in H, control in C, control in D not denied
      2C/2D - 4D     : Superfit in H, 5 card support. Responder was going to
       reverse in H, control in D, no control in C
      2C/2D - 4H     : Superfit in H, 5 card support, Responder was going to
       reverse in H, C or D control,  minimum hand
      2C/2D - 3H     : Superfit in H, 5 card support, Responder was going to
       reverse in H, better hand, inviting cue bidding

 iii) 1H by opener followed by 2S

      2C/2D - 4C     : Fit in H, responder was going to employ superfit call,
       control in C/D. control in other minor not denied
      2C/2D - 4D     : Fit in S, 5 card support, responder was going to reverse
       in S, no controls promised in C or D, better hand
       inviting cue bid
      2C/2D - 4S     : Fit in S, 5 card support, responder was going to reverse
       in S, minimum hand, control in C and D not denied
      2C/2D - 3S     : Fit in S, 5 card support, responder was going to reverse
       in S, better hand, inviting cue bidding

    Summary
    -------
   i) On rebid of same major or 2NT, responder's 2C/2D followed by 4C/4D shows
      controls and type of controls in C/D
  ii) On opener's 1S/2H, responder's 2C/2D followed by jump to 3S shows superfit
      in S and jump to 4C/D shows reversible hand in H and control in C/D but
      jump to 4H shows minimum hand denying controls in C/D. With
      better hand, responder raises 2H to 3H, still showing reversible hand and
      inviting cue bidding
 iii) On opener's 1H/2S reverse, responder's 2C/2D followed by jump to 4C shows
      reversible hand in H and jump to 4D shows reversible hand in S.
      Jump to 4S shows minimum reversible hand and raise to 3S shows better
      reversible hand in S.
6.

SLAM Bidding

   i) 4NT is Ace asking ONLY of bid by opener or responder in second round
      of bidding or when it is with a jump. Otherwise, if suit has matched and
      4NT is bid after cue-bids, it shows willingness to play at 5 level and
      asks for continuation of cue bidding. If suit is not matched, it is
      QUANTITATIVE asking partner to bid six with additional values or else
      sign off.
  ii) Principle of fast approach means that after strong opening support or
      after responder shows 12+, if partner jumps to game, there is no slam
      aspiration and hand is minimum, but if suit is matched with a single
      raise, there is slam ambition and cue bids must continue below the game
      level.
 iii) When suit has matched, cue bid shows first or second round control (A,K
      singleton or void) starting from lowest bid. If a suit is bypassed, it
      initially denies a control, but if that suit is bid next time it shows
      first round control in first cue bid and second round control in
      second cue bid.
  iv) After a jump bid, showing semi-solid six carder partner should raise with
      any three carder or Qx to set the scene for cue bidding.
   v) After cue bids, the partner holding minimum hand should not go beyond the
      game level. Crossing game level shows additional value.
  vi) Having bypassed a suit in cue bidding twice, and then bidding shows third
      round control i.e. Qxx or xx.
 vii) Jump to 5NT asks partner to show quality of the suit agreed. Partner is
      to bid 7 with two top honors, otherwise:
      S Suit:         6S: Suit headed with A or K, min 4 carder
      6H: Suit headed with A or K
      6D: Suit headed with Q
      5C: Suit headed with J or less

      H Suit          6H: Suit headed with A or K
      6D: Suit headed with Q
      6C: Suit headed with J or less

      D Suit          6D: Suit headed with A or K
      6C: Suit headed with Q or less

      C Suit          6C: Suit lacks 2 top honors
viii) Responses to 4NT, if Ace asking are
      5C : 4 or 1
      5D : 3 or 0
      5H : Two Aces same rank (both majors or minors)
      5S : Two Aces mixed (neither same rank nor same color (S and D or H and C)
      5NT: Two Aces of same color (either both black or both red)

      To remember: 41-30-RMC (rank/mixed/color)

  D, 4 carder open 1S and then D with no tolerance for H but tolerance
  for C so that if partner bids 2H, opener can bid 2NT showing minimum.
  With tolerance for H, but no tolerance in C, open 1D)

  Canape' style, second suit is at least as long as first (may be 4-4)
  but EXCEPTION: After 1NT, response, first suit may be longer than
  second as effort is to find the best fit on unbalanced hands

    Summary
    -------
    i) 15-16 hands are to be treated as 13-14 unless the hand contains at least
       one good five carder.
   ii) Single suiter hands are bid by opener by min NT, raise, rebid,lower suit,
       if 13-14 and by jump to 2NT if 15-16. Jump in suit always promises six
       carder semi-solid suit.
  iii) Two suiter hands 13-14 are bid canape' style higher/lower. With S & D as
       suits 4-4, open S with tolerance for C and D with tolerance for H. Three
       suiter 4-4-4-1 hands are opened selecting the 2 best suits, in canape'
       style.
   iv) Two suiter 15-16 hands are opened lower/higher (second suit always five
       carder). Jump in second suit promises first suit 4 carder, second suit
       semi-solid six carder (except when jump is in C, in which case C is
       4 carder and first suit is semi-solid). Jump in responser's suit shows
       reversible hand, five card support.
    v) Responder's 2 over 1 is forcing to 2NT level. Response of 2C/2D may be
       three carder with values in the suit to prepare for reverse or show
       superfit in opener's major.
   vi) Responder's second jump in own suit is limited semi-solid six carder but
       first round jump in a suit or second round jump in new suit shows semi-
       solid six carder with first suit as 4 carder (unless superfit calls are
       used).
  vii) Responder's second round jump in opener's minor (D) is limited,
       non-forcing, but in opener's major is forcing.


PART VII - DEFENSIVE BIDDING
1.

TWO SUITER HANDS 5 - 5 (3rd and 4th position)

   Legend: SAPV (Strength as per vulnerability)
   weak:    6-11, Non-vul vs Vul

   If strength does not match SAPV calls above, the two suits are bid in a
   natural manner. Partner bids naturally showing preference in two suits with a
   jump or cue bid if in game zone.

    Summary
    -------
    i) Double of a suit call shows hand of same strength as opener's with min.
       3 card support in remaining suits. Jump by partner shows 10+, cue bid
       shows 12+. If partner responds without jump, doubler must pass with
       13-15, but may take another bid with 16_, jump or cue bid with 19+. If
       16+, 3 card support in remaining suits is not necessary.
   ii) Simple 1NT/2NT overcall shows 16-18 with a stopper, but if initial
       double, it shows 19-21 with a stopper.
  iii) Special bids for two suiters are used specifying strength of the hand. If
       the strength does not fit in the specified calls, hand is bid in a
       natural fashion.
   iv) Simple 1 over 1 over calls shows good five carder suit while 2 over 1
       shows 8+, with very good six carder suit
    v) Jump in a new suit shows semi-solid six carder suit, strength varying
       according to vulnerability.
