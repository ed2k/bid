      RESPONSES AFTER INTERVENTION
a) After Double by opponents:
      Pass: 0-7 with 4+ card C
      1D: 0-7 with 3 or less card C
        Redouble: 8 pts, two 4 card majors
Other calls: natural as without intervention
b) After an overcall up to 2S:
      Pass: 0-4
        double: 5-8 pts, no 5c suit
        suit bid: 5-8 pts, 5c suit
        jump suit bid: 5-8 pts, 6c+ suit
min NT: 9+, 5c+ suit, unbalanced
jump NT: 9-11 balanced, stopper in opponents suit
3NT over a 1 level overcall: 12-14, stopper in opponents suit
                Cuebid: 9+ no good 5c suit, no stopper in opponents suit
NOTE: Many play 1NT over a 1 level overcall as normal 8-10 pt
balanced and stopper, and use cuebid instead.
b) After an overcall greater than 2S:
double: Penalty
3NT: 9-12, 1 good stopper
Suit: Good 5c+, probable game
  Cuebid: Strong takeout

      After a POSITIVE suit response,
      Raise of that suit is TRUMP ASKING BID called TAB.
      No top 3 honors: 1st step, 5+ carder
      1 top honor=2nd step 5 carder
      2 top honor=3rd step, 5 carder
      1 top honor=4th step, 6 carder
      2 top honors=5th step, 6 carder
      3 top honor=6th step, 5+ carder
      Jump shift=19pts, semi solid 6 carder with max 1 top honor missing
      this is ACE ASKING BID (AAB)
      Cheapest NT: No top honor, no side Ace
      single raise: top honor in openers suit, no side Ace
      New Suit: No top honor, Ace is sut bid
      Jump in new suit: Top honor in openers suit, side A in suit bid
      Jump in NT: No top honor, 2 side Aces
      Jump raise: Top honor, 2 side Aces
      Ater opener has applied TAB or AAB, any suit bid is CONTROL ASKING BID
      (CAB).
      1st step: 3 or more low cards (No control)
      2nd step: Doubleton or Q (3rd round control)
      3rd step: Singleton or K (2nd round control)
      4th step: void or Ace    (1st round control)
      5th step: AK or AQ       (1st and 2nd round control)
      Opener can then rebid the suit to find out if control is honor or
      ruffing.  (Goren omits this, but it was in original precision and is
      included in other versions.)  The replies are:
        1st step: ruffing
              2nd step: honor
      TAB and CAB after intervening bid by opponents:
      1st step: Double
      2nd step: Pass
      3rd step: next higher bid .......
